This project creates a 3D interactive web animation that displays images dynamically in a rotating cube. Each side of the cube shows a different image, with smaller and larger sets of images (minbox and maxbox). A looping background music adds an immersive experience. The 3D effect and interactivity are achieved using HTML, CSS animations, and JavaScript.
